%%
% The CalculateMeanIndepCov function finds the mean and covariance of each
% class assuming independent covariance
%
% The parameters received are:
% - X (n x m): n is the number of samples, and m the number of features
% - y (n x 1): Vector that should contain the labels 1 or 2 for each sample
%
% The function should return:
% - m1 (m x 1): Mean for class 1. 
% - m2 (m x 1): Mean for class 2. 
% - S1 (m x m): Covariance for class 1. 
% - S2 (m x m): Covariance for class 2. 
%
% You should be able to test the function by executing:
% [m1,m2,S1,S2] = CalculateMeanIndepCov(X_trn, y_trn)
%
function [m1,m2,S1,S2] = CalculateMeanIndepCov(X, y)
